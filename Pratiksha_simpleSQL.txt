1) Write a query for the HR department to produce the addresses of all the departments.
    Use the LOCATIONS and COUNTRIES tables. Show the location ID, street address,
    city, state or province, and country in the output. Run the query

2) The HR department needs a report of employees in Toronto. Display the last name, job,

    King.
  
= SELECT last_name,salary from employees WHERE manager_id=(select employee_id from employees Where last_name='king');

4) Create Table MY_EMPLOYEE. Description is shown below:
=CREATE table MY_EMPLOYEE( ID int NOT NULL,LAST_NAME varchar(25),FIRST_NAME varchar(25),USER_ID varchar(8),salary int);


5) Add the following data to the MY_EMPLOYEE table :
=  insert into my_employee values
(1,'Ralph','Patel','rpatel',895),
(2,'Betty','dance','bdancs',860),

      a view called EMPLOYEES_VU based on the employee numbers, employee last names, and 
     department numbers from the EMPLOYEES table. The heading for the employee name should be  
     EMPLOYEE.

     Confirm that the view works. Display the contents of the EMPLOYEES_VU view

 create view employees_vu AS select employee_id,last_name AS Employee,department_id from employees;
select *from employees_vu;
